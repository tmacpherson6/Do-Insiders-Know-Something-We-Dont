    "# Insider Transaction Processing\n",
    "This notebook is the second in our pipeline of analyzing insider transactions. In this notebook, our focus will be on extracting important infromation from all of the archived Form 4 ZIP files that we retrieved from the SEC website (See `Notebook 1 - donload_sec_zips.ipynb`). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline:  \n",
    "1) Load all SEC Form 4 filing ZIP archives (source:https://www.sec.gov/data-research/sec-markets-data/insider-transactions-data-sets) that have been downloaded locally to the dir: sec_zips.\n",
    "2) Extract and process three .tsv files ('NONDERIV_TRANS.tsv, 'REPORTINGOWNER.tsv','SUBMISSION.tsv'). We will filter down to only insider transactions (non-entity LPs, Funds, Trusts, etc.) and focus on open-market purchases. For details on the data contained in these ZIP files see 'insider_transactions_readme.pdf' in the github repository.  \n",
    "3) Clean data by removing any invalid records (missing roles, etc.)  \n",
    "4) Concatenate records from all ZIP files and export to a stable CSV file for future work\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is relatively easy to adjust this notebook for future analysis if we decide that we want to look at entities or do a deeper dive into why invalid records exist."
