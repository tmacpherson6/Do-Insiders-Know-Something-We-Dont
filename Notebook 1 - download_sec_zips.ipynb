    "### Intial Notes\n",
    "This notebook originiated from the work of Kirtland Corregan in our Milestone I porject of the Master's of Applied Data Science. I have forked the original data that can be seen here: https://github.com/RamiHaider/Do-Insiders-Know-Something-We-Dont. The reason for doing this is two fold. Firstly, I want to run through the code line by line in order to fully undestand and implement the data aquisition phase of the project. Secondly, I want to expand all files that I didn't do personally so they are in a Jupyter Notebook format for easy explanation and reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases I may change the code in order to follow more strict coding guidelines or for more efficient processes. I plan on continuing the project in my own time for a more deep analysis and hope to use it for further generation of alpha.\n",

We have designed the paths to store locally for further processing in analysis. The current working directory will be the one where this notebook is saved.\n",
